1.  How does SASS works in this folder ?

    a. react_sass:

        - Wrote sass file in the /react_sass/src/styles and /react_sass/src/variables

        - css file got imported in react.js components (not scss file)

        - The CSS file got compiled from the SCSS by the Live Sass Compiler extension
